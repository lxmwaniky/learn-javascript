                1. Variable names can contain letters (A to Z and a to z), numbers (0 to 9) and underscores (_)
                2. No Spaces are used
                2. A valid JavaScript identifier must start with a letter (A–Z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
                3. Avoid using reserved words as variable names (e.g., "let", "var")
                4. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful
                5. If your language has specific conventions or requirements, follow them
